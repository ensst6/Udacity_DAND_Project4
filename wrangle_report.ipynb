    "## Purpose\n",
    "The purpose of this report was to wrangle data associated with the [WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dogrates) Twitter feed so that it would be suitable for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gather\n",
    "The 'We Rate Dogs' twitter archive was provided as the flat file `twitter-archive-enhanced.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "The image prediction file `image-predictions.tsv` was downloaded programmatically from Udacity using `Requests`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extended tweet information for the twitter archive, including favorite and retweet counts, was obtained from the Twitter API via the `Tweepy` interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assess\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quality\n",
    "##### `twitter_arch` table (from provided file)\n",
    "- contains retweets\n",
    "- some of the tweets are about non-dog items ('guys, we only rate dogs')\n",
    "- `rating_numerator` and `rating denominator` contain values that are not ratings\n",
    "- `rating numerator` and `rating_denominator` contain some ratings for multiple dogs\n",
    "- `name` field contains several non-name entries (e.g., a, an, the, very, just, quite)\n",
    "- `timestamp` and `retweeted_status_timestamp` are strings, not datetime\n",
    "- `in_reply_to_status_id`,`in_reply_to_user_id`, `retweeted_status_id` and `retweeted_user_id` are floats, not ints\n",
    "- dog stage contains multiple assignments (should be unique)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `image_preds` table (from downloaded file)\n",
    "- inconsistent capitalization of descriptors in `p1`, `p2`, `p3`\n",
    "- tweets without images (N in this table < N in Twitter archive)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `ext_tweet` table (via Twitter API)\n",
    "- some tweets no longer accessible (N of this table < N of twitter archive table)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tidiness\n",
    "##### `twitter_arch` table \n",
    "- Dog stage is four fields, each of which contains \"None\" or the column name\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `image_preds` table\n",
    "- Image prediction table should be combined with the main archive table since there is one entry per tweet\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `ext_tweet` table \n",
    "- Extended tweet info (retweet & favorite counts) should be part of the main archive table\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clean\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `twitter_arch`\n",
    "1. Contains retweets: delete retweet entries \n",
    "2. Contains tweets that are not about dogs: delete non-dog entries. These are assumed to be any containg the phrase 'we only rate dogs'.\n",
    "3. Ratings contain non-rating values: replace these with ratings if able; otherwise delete. Many of these are parsing errors where some other `x/y`-type string was taken as the rating. By manually sifting the text, some of these were found to contain other text with ratings.\n",
    "4. Ratings contain ratings for multiple dogs: delete. Remove to standardize dataset to single-dog ratings. These ratings also contain multiplicative denominators (e.g. 110, 120) which are inconsistent with the bulk of ratings.\n",
    "5. Field `name` contains non-name entries: change them to 'None'. They are all lower-case, whereas actual names are capitalized.\n",
    "6. Fields `timestamp` and `retweeted_status_timestamp` are strings, not datetime: convert `timestamp` to datetime. `retweeted_status_timestamp` was deleted during step 1.\n",
    "7. Fields `in_reply_to_status_id`,`in_reply_to_user_id`, `retweeted_status_id` and `retweeted_user_id` are floats, not ints: convert `in_reply_to_status_id` and `in_reply_to_user_id`to int. `retweeted_status_id` and `retweeted_user_id` were deleted in step 1. \n",
    "8. Some entries contain mutliple stage entries: remove these. They appear to be for multiple dogs or non-dogs. Want to limit to single dogs and stage entry should be unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `image_preds`\n",
    "1. Inconsistent capitalization of descriptors in `p1`, `p2`, `p3`: make all entries lowercase\n",
    "2. Tweets without images (N in this table < N in Twitter archive): this will be addressed in \"Tidiness\" when the tables are merged.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `ext_tweet` \n",
    "1. Some tweets no longer accessible (N of this table < N of twitter archive table): this will be addressed in \"Tidiness\" when the tables are merged.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tidiness\n",
    "##### `twitter_arch` table \n",
    "1. Dog stage is four fields, each of which contains \"None\" or the column name: merge these into single column `stage` with a categorical entry for each stage or \"None\".\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `image_preds` table\n",
    "1. Image prediction table should be combined with the main archive table: join it with `twitter_arch`. An inner join will eliminate the tweets without images.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `ext_tweet` table \n",
    "1. Extended tweet info (retweet & favorite counts) should be part of the main archive table: join it with `twitter_arch`. An inner join will eliminate the tweets that were no longer available when the API was accessed."
